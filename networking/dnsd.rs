ID      16 bit random identifier assigned by querying peer.
        Used to match query/response.
QR      message is a query (0), or a response (1).
OPCODE  0   standard query (QUERY)
        1   inverse query (IQUERY)
        2   server status request (STATUS)
AA      Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses.
        Responding name server is an authority for the domain name
        in question section. Answer section may have multiple owner names
        because of aliases.  The AA bit corresponds to the name which matches
        the query name, or the first owner name in the answer section.
TC      TrunCation - this message was truncated.
RD      Recursion Desired - this bit may be set in a query and
        is copied into the response.  If RD is set, it directs
        the name server to pursue the query recursively.
        Recursive query support is optional.
RA      Recursion Available - this be is set or cleared in a
        response, and denotes whether recursive query support is
        available in the name server.
RCODE   Response code.
        0   No error condition
        1   Format error
        2   Server failure - server was unable to process the query
            due to a problem with the name server.
        3   Name Error - meaningful only for responses from
            an authoritative name server. The referenced domain name
            does not exist.
        4   Not Implemented.
        5   Refused.
QDCOUNT number of entries in the question section.
ANCOUNT number of records in the answer section.
NSCOUNT number of records in the authority records section.
ARCOUNT number of records in the additional records section.

4.1.2. Question section format

The section contains QDCOUNT (usually 1) entries, each of this format:
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    /                     QNAME                     /
    /                                               /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
QNAME   a domain name represented as a sequence of labels, where
        each label consists of a length octet followed by that
        number of octets. The domain name terminates with the
        zero length octet for the null label of the root. Note
        that this field may be an odd number of octets; no
        padding is used.
QTYPE   a two octet type of the query.
          1 a host address [REQ_A const]
          2 an authoritative name server
          3 a mail destination (Obsolete - use MX)
          4 a mail forwarder (Obsolete - use MX)
          5 the canonical name for an alias
          6 marks the start of a zone of authority
          7 a mailbox domain name (EXPERIMENTAL)
          8 a mail group member (EXPERIMENTAL)
          9 a mail rename domain name (EXPERIMENTAL)
         10 a null RR (EXPERIMENTAL)
         11 a well known service description
         12 a domain name pointer [REQ_PTR const]
         13 host information
         14 mailbox or mail list information
         15 mail exchange
         16 text strings
       0x1c IPv6?
        252 a request for a transfer of an entire zone
        253 a request for mailbox-related records (MB, MG or MR)
        254 a request for mail agent RRs (Obsolete - see MX)
        255 a request for all records
QCLASS  a two octet code that specifies the class of the query.
          1 the Internet
        (others are historic only)
        255 any class

4.1.3. Resource Record format

The answer, authority, and additional sections all share the same format:
a variable number of resource records, where the number of records
is specified in the corresponding count field in the header.
Each resource record has this format:
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    /                                               /
    /                      NAME                     /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                      TYPE                     |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                     CLASS                     |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                      TTL                      |
    |                                               |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                   RDLENGTH                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--|
    /                     RDATA                     /
    /                                               /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
NAME    a domain name to which this resource record pertains.
TYPE    two octets containing one of the RR type codes.  This
        field specifies the meaning of the data in the RDATA field.
CLASS   two octets which specify the class of the data in the RDATA field.
TTL     a 32 bit unsigned integer that specifies the time interval
        (in seconds) that the record may be cached.
RDLENGTH a 16 bit integer, length in octets of the RDATA field.
RDATA   a variable length string of octets that describes the resource.
        The format of this information varies according to the TYPE
        and CLASS of the resource record.
        If the TYPE is A and the CLASS is IN, it's a 4 octet IP address.

4.1.4. Message compression

In order to reduce the size of messages, domain names coan be compressed.
An entire domain name or a list of labels at the end of a domain name
is replaced with a pointer to a prior occurrence of the same name.

The pointer takes the form of a two octet sequence:
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    | 1  1|                OFFSET                   |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
The first two bits are ones.  This allows a pointer to be distinguished
from a label, since the label must begin with two zero bits because
labels are restricted to 63 octets or less.  The OFFSET field specifies
an offset from the start of the message (i.e., the first octet
of the ID field in the domain header).
A zero offset specifies the first byte of the ID field, etc.
Domain name in a message can be represented as either:
   - a sequence of labels ending in a zero octet
   - a pointer
   - a sequence of labels ending with a pointer
