/* Mar 16, 2003      Manuel Novoa III   (mjn3@codepoet.org)
 *
 * Rewritten to fix a number of problems and do some size optimizations.
 * Problems in the previous busybox implementation (besides bloat) included:
 *  1) broken 'wc -c' optimization (read note below)
 *  2) broken handling of '-' args
 *  3) no checking of ferror on EOF returns
 *  4) isprint() wasn't considered when word counting.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The previous busybox wc attempted an optimization using stat for the
 * case of counting chars only.  I omitted that because it was broken.
 * It didn't take into account the possibility of input coming from a
 * pipe, or input from a file with file pointer not at the beginning.
 *
 * To implement such a speed optimization correctly, not only do you
 * need the size, but also the file position.  Note also that the
 * file position may be past the end of file.  Consider the example
 * (adapted from example in gnu wc.c)
 *
 *      echo hello > /tmp/testfile &&
 *      (dd ibs=1k skip=1 count=0 &> /dev/null; wc -c) < /tmp/testfile
 *
 * for which 'wc -c' should output '0'.
